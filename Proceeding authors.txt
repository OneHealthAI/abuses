Thanks again for the feedback and insights on the cycle of abuses in and outside our practices and centers. I am now offering to co-author the attached proceedings paper, on the series of symposiums once also supported by FOSTREN on ongoing cases of political abuses of psychiatry Worldwide. It was a presentations - webinar series of sorts, two months of talks that started from a World Psychiatric Association session with Rob Keukens and Robert van Voren, later canceled. Robert, from the Geneva Initative, created his own WPA satellite event in Viena. I decided to run that online. We hosted the following named speakers, and an additional one -medical practitioner from Ecuador- who required to be annonymous due to the life threatening situation he was enduring:

Dear Nick, Bob, Luís,


First off, thanks and my apologies to everyone in the list. It keeps on suspiciously malfunction on me, and I have to be careful when sending messages for it all not to be screwed. Has been happening only with the CPN one, already notified Marguerite. If malware or similar, it is targeted to hinder the efforts to communicate with you in specific, as far as I noticed. Looking forward to sort it out, see what it is. Anyone else has noticed emails being sent automatically while typing to the list? Other strange things going on?

Bob: your experience deserves a paper on itself, be more widely known, as that of all who have endured backlash for being honest. Would you like to join forces? May I, we, help with this ploy. Happy to be accomplices of yours!

Luís: yes, please join us. The plan now is to check together the contents, and submit it for publications from 15th of May to 1st of June tops. It is a collective round of improvements, selecting journal together, and we take it from there. henning.garcia@urv.cat , happy if you share it with other colleagues willing to help out on this and next publications and events.

Nick: I would also say series of papers. This deserves a research line, funding and perseverance. A legal team, to enforce law: what is ignored, even by enforcement agents and justices in this corrupt mileau we are researching. This is the sad reality accounted by many, suffered by myself as well as host, leading that many to lives of suffering, illegal detention, forced disappearances, and eventually death. An economy of pain and despair, desolation, geared also to silence and kept in the dark to continue. Political major crimes against humanity. Medical torture, regardless of the interests of each actor involved in each particular case. This is something that gets into domestic violence as well, even those disputes can lead to someone locked in our current scenario. We all know, family abuse victims are treated as ill, their life stories also very often never told, never acknowledged. From micro to macro politics, we are all part of this body politic and victims of the law of men instead of the rule of law proper. I am thrilled to count you in the small team working on the publication. Everyone is invited to join us. It took two years from late 2023 to work on this, due to the violence and abuses I faced after hosting the event series. We also need legal protection, as there were abuses, violence and threats during the event, still not properly acknowledged nor effectively brought to justice. Some speakers faced backlash, were already threatened, some as myself cruelly aggressed. I will be thrilled to keep on collaborating in any capacity, to keep on delving into structural and systemic violence and silencing of professionals willing to report, targeted individuals due to political reasons or any other interest, and the body politic at large. This is a problem that needs talked about, and doing so will help prevent other sorts of abuses and violence.

Thanks again for the feedback and insights on the cycle of abuses in and outside our practices and centers.
