that they are going to tie you up basically then

that they are going to tie you up basically then
the <01:16:46.571><c>medication </c><01:16:46.742><c>that's </c><01:16:46.913><c>why </c><01:16:47.084><c>we </c><01:16:47.255><c>say </c><01:16:47.426><c>that </c><01:16:47.597><c>the</c>

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
the medication that's why we say that the
 

01:16:47.679 --> 01:16:49.270 align:start position:0%
the medication that's why we say that the
medication <01:16:47.959><c>is </c><01:16:48.239><c>forced </c><01:16:48.519><c>that </c><01:16:48.799><c>is </c><01:16:49.079><c>another</c>

01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
medication is forced that is another
 

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.709 align:start position:0%

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.910 align:start position:0%
is during the entire admission then the type

01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
of restraint
 

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:27.149 align:start position:0%
of restraint
that <01:17:24.446><c>this </c><01:17:24.972><c>is </c><01:17:25.498><c>quite </c><01:17:26.024><c>the </c><01:17:26.550><c>type </c><01:17:27.076><c>of</c>

01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
that this is quite the type of
 

01:17:27.159 --> 01:17:28.950 align:start position:0%
that this is quite the type of
restraint <01:17:27.471><c>is </c><01:17:27.783><c>quite </c><01:17:28.095><c>horrible </c><01:17:28.407><c>because </c><01:17:28.719><c>it</c>

01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
restraint is quite horrible because it
 

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.629 align:start position:0%
restraint is quite horrible because it

depends on the parts of the body in which they
 

01:17:31.639 --> 01:17:34.790 align:start position:0%
depends on the parts of the body in which they
tie <01:17:32.012><c>you </c><01:17:32.385><c>so </c><01:17:32.758><c>well</c>

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
tie you so well
 

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:39.629 align:start position:0%
tie you so well
And <01:17:35.380><c>that </c><01:17:35.960><c>is </c><01:17:36.540><c>the </c><01:17:37.120><c>the </c><01:17:37.700><c>average </c><01:17:38.280><c>of </c><01:17:38.860><c>Oh </c><01:17:39.440><c>the</c>
